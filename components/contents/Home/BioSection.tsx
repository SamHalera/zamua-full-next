          The first time I sang in front of someone, I was seven years old. It
          was in front of my family. I did something that vaguely sounded like
          rap music.
        </p>
        <p className=" italic">
          There was no rap music being played at home; in fact, I&apos;m still
          not sure where I got that powerful music from... My father often
          listened to jazz radio shows. I recall Louis Armstrong&apos;s trumpet
          playing in the mornings while we ate breakfast, as well as the vocals
          of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Tracy Chapman, Luigi Tenco, Lucio Dalla,
          and Fabrizio De Andr√©.
        </p>
        <p className=" italic font-semibold">
          Today, when I listen to the recording of that first so-called
          performance, I understand that when the music hits, it leaves an
          indelible mark...
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold">
          This sensation endures until one realizes that the greatest way to
          appreciate music is to create it, to bring it to life...
